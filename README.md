## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I leared some more about SVGs when working with the included SVGs. Espescially when working on the sharebutton. I also leared some about ::befoer/::after pseudo elements.

### Continued development

I wonder if I have to structure my projects a bit diffrent. For the most part though, I think I just need to get some more hands-on practice with HTML, CSS and JS in combination.
